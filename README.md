# OfficeKeyFix

Unbinds the Office Key (Shift+Control+Alt+Win) related shortcuts, allowing you to use Office+W in other applications.

# Build

You'll need to compile the script into a binary, and place it in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` so it will run on startup.

# Authors

Originally by Anthony Heddings, whose account disappeared years ago. My fork became the new source (presumably) because it just happened to be the oldest.

# License

To my knowledge Heddings did not leave behind a license or any way to be contacted, just released the code and dipped a year or so later without ever responding to a single message.
I believe that this software is useful but that there is no other reasonable way to perform this task in C++ due to the sheer simplicity of it, making it difficult to argue copyrights.
Thus, to maintain continuity for the people forking and using it I am placing further changes under the [BSD license](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause).
This license was chosen because it is the most permissive license which also includes a non-endorsement clause.
